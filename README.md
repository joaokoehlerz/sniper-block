# sniper-block
Team Fortress 2 plugin that blocks the sniper class in pugs by total time played and total number of switches.
It was made to be used in competitive 6v6 pugs. The count (both time and class switches) only starts when a tournament match is also started. Pregame isn't affected.
# Usage
`sm_sniperblock_max` Max number of times a player can switch to sniper
<br>
`sm_sniperblock_time` Max time in seconds a player can stay on sniper
